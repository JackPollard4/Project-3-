To analyze the effects of COVID-19 in Uganda, our code compares pre- and post-pandemic years: 2013–14 (pre-COVID) and 2019–20 (post-COVID). To switch between these periods, update the year in two places in the code where it’s marked with # CHANGE YEAR (2013-14 or 2019-20) and Run Cell. This ensures the correct data is loaded for expenditures, prices, and household characteristics.
