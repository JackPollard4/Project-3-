To analyze the effects of COVID-19 in Uganda, our code compares pre- and post-pandemic years: 2013–14 (pre-COVID) and 2019–20 (post-COVID). To switch between these periods, update the year in two places in the code where it’s marked with # CHANGE YEAR (2013-14 or 2019-20) and Run Cell. This ensures the correct data is loaded for expenditures, prices, and household characteristics.






## Project Topic & Goals

This project compares nutritional and food intake patterns in the U.S. and Uganda before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on:

- Contrasting dietary patterns between the two countries across pre- and post-COVID timeframes.
- Exploring rural vs. urban differences in the relationship between diet, budget, and prices.
- Using 2017 data (U.S.) and 2013–14 data (Uganda) to establish pre-pandemic baselines, and **2021 (U.S.) / 2019–20 (Uganda) to analyze post-pandemic impacts.
- Investigating how rising food prices after COVID-19 affected the ability of households to meet dietary requirements.

## Switching Between Pre- and Post-COVID Data (Uganda)

To analyze the effects of COVID-19 in Uganda, the code uses:

- `2013–14` as the **pre-COVID year
- `2019–20` as the **post-COVID year

To switch between these periods in the code:

1. Locate the lines marked with:
   ```python
   # CHANGE YEAR (2013-14 or 2019-20)
